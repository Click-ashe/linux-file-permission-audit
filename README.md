# Linux File Permissions Audit & Hardening  
### A Practical Security Project for SOC Analysts

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how Linux commands are used to **audit**, **analyze**, and **secure** file permissions within a research environment. The goal is to ensure that only authorized users have the correct level of access while reducing the risk of unauthorized modification or exposure of sensitive files.

This exercise reflects real SOC analyst responsibilities, including baseline auditing, identifying permission risks, and applying least‑privilege principles.

## Objectives
- Establish a baseline of current file and directory permissions  
- Identify permission‑related security risks  
- Apply least‑privilege access controls  
- Remove unauthorized or world‑writable access  
- Strengthen overall system security
